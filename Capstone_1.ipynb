    "The way people consume music has changed drastically in the passed few decades, transforming from a selling industry to a streaming industry. A indisputable giant of this industry is the platform Spotify, which was seeing as many as 100,000 new additions to its catalog daily at the end of 2022. From the perspective of artists, the growing nature of the industry is foreshadowing greater opportunities, as well greater competition. For that reason the ability to make data driven decisions has become invaluable and essential for any artists hoping to find success on a platform which is slowly becoming oversaturated with content. This project will start by taking a look at a dataset found on Kaggle that was sourced directly from the Spotify API. Using this dataset we can explore and process the data and attempt fitting a classification model that can predict whether a track is popular or not given a set of features."

    "This notebook will start with an initial exploration How to Spotify data sets found on Kaggle. After exploring the significance of the features available we will move on to pulling a fresh and more balanced dataset directly from the Spotify API. The reason for this is because upon initial examination of the Kaggle page it seems that the data set was pulled with certain specifications in mind that end up making it problematic for fitting a model."

    "Otherwise, the data sets consists of 65,871 Tracks with 22 features. This is less than half the size of the kaggle dataset, however, there is a new feature that should prove useful (release_date), a supplementary feature that will aid the presentation of this project (preview_url), 9 new genres, and most importantly a far more balanced target value. The final dataset is stored in the Data folder as both a .csv file (pulled_dataset.csv) and as a pickle file (pulled_dataset.pkl).\n",
